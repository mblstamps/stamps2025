# Application submission info

> Submitted on 21-May-2025; approved -2025 (BIO250171)
---

Submitted through ACCESS: https://access-ci.org/

Submitted a "Discover ACCESS", different types listed here: https://allocations.access-ci.org/project-types

> Prior to 2025, an "Explore ACCESS" was the way to go. But they no longer would give us the full 400,000 credits up front, so this year switched to requesting a "Discover ACCESS request which has more credits up front.

After logged in, submission process started from this page: https://allocations.access-ci.org/opportunities

Then selecting to "Request New Project", and choosing "Request a Discover ACCESS project".

## Required information I added to the form

**Title:** STAMPS 2025 at Marine Biologial Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, USA

**Public overview:**  

> General overview
> The STAMPS course (Strategies and Techniques for Analyzing Microbial Population Structures) has been a yearly event at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA, USA for over a decade, helping nearly 1,000 learners establish a foundation in bioinformatics over the years. Since 2019 we have been fortunate enough to have our computational infrastructure provided through XSEDE, then ACCESS, and Jetstream (1 and 2), and we hope to continue that this year. The course takes place 14-July to 24-July and will involve a lot of command-line, R, amplicon analysis, metagenomics, statistical training, and other concepts and computational activities (last year's schedule can be seen here: https://github.com/mblstamps/stamps2024/wiki#schedule).

**Keywords:** microbial ecology, bioinformatics

**How do you plan to use this project?** Classroom / Training

**Opportunity questions:**
- Would you like us to provide an advisory review? No
- Is the planned work associated with any of the following? No
- How did you hear about ACCESS? Word of mouth

**Fields of Science:** “Other Biological Sciences”

**Supporting Grants?** No

**Documents:** Needed to attach the main request doc and my CV here.

**Available resources:** checked box for ACCESS Credits

### Transferring credits from ACCESS to JetStream2

Once approved, and logged in, needed this page (https://allocations.access-ci.org/requests) in order to transfer ACCESS credits to a specific resource. For the appropriate allocation/Project, selected "Credits + Resources", then the text box that initially says "Add a resource to your exchange...", then selected "Indiana Jetstream2 CPU", then entered 196,000 (since I did this before the other 200,000 were available). Then for "Indiana Jetstream2 Storage" added the remaining 4,000, giving 4 TB of shared storage to use.
After the other 200,000 are made available (see next section), repeat the process without adding anymore to Storage.

### Getting the remaining 200,000 credits
> I tried to do this once _before_ transferring the first 200,000 credits, and it seemed to be a problem as the supplement request was denied - and asking for help was not working. So I think it's better to do this _after_ doing an initial transfer of the first 200,000 credits as noted in the prior section. 

The “Explore ACCESS” project at this time comes with a total of 400,000 credits, with 200,000 released at first. After getting approved, I went to the https://allocations.access-ci.org/requests page, selected the STAMPS 2025 project, clicked on “Credits + Resources”, then “REQUEST MORE CREDITS”, then “REQUEST MORE CREDITS” again, then “REQUEST A SUPPLEMENT”. Then filled out these:
- Reason: 
  -	This allocation is for a course that will be using all the credits rapidly over a 10-11 day period. In the past, we have been granted the full 400,000 right up front, which is extremely helpful. Could we please do that again?
Thanks!
- Available Resources:
  -	Checked the box for ACCESS Credits
- Document Type:
  -	A Progress Report is required. This was just a PDF stating the same as the “Reason” above.

Then submitted the form.

### Requesting quota-limit increases so we can run up to 60 instances concurrently, and requesting Manila (for shared volume)

The allocation comes with a limit on the number of concurrent instances that can be run. I submitted a request when logged into Jetstream2 here: https://jetstream2.exosphere.app/exosphere/getsupport

This is the text I submitted (after selecting the radio dial for “An Allocation”):

> Hi there :)
> 
> We plan to use this allocation (BIO240064) with 60 concurrent m3.large instances for a bioinformatics course we are running. The starting limit is set to 10.
> 
> Could you please help with increasing the allotted quotas so that we will be able to run up to 60 m3.large instances concurrently on this allocation, including cores, ram, volume, ports, available IP addresses, and whatever other magic you folks take care of?
>
> We would also like to be able to use the 4 TB we specified for Jetstream2 Storage as a shared volume attached to all instances. We've done this with Manila in the past. Could you please enable that for us?
>
> Thank you for any help!
